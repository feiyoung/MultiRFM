Description: We introduce a high-dimensional multi-study robust factor model, called MultiRFM, which learns latent features and accounts for the heterogeneity among source. It could be used for analyzing heterogeneous RNA sequencing data. More details can be referred to Jiang et al. (2025) <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2506.18478>.
